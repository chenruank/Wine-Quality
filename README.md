Your project must utilize the dataset provided to your team

Make use of 1 library not covered in the scope of this course, and be prepared to discuss the implementation, and impact on your project overall
Github is highly recommended though not required for code management and tracing contributions/commits. One teammate may be in charge of utilizing and managing a team Github Repo if they choose.

Data must be cleaned thoroughly, to ensure a robust data set. Please take the time to clearly and explicitly establish the statistical significance of your sample data, as it relates to your hypotheses, and verify that your dataset is robust while explaining what makes it robust.

Your team should include a minimum of 5 visualizations, with each group member having a contributing influence on the design or creation of at least one each.

Perform pertinent machine learning algorithms with your dataset, and outline which types of machine learning you are utilizing in each case, while describing what each type of machine learning is in the context of your project.

Conclude your project with a clear description of what takeaways you gathered from your project, and what takeaways you wish the viewer could gain from your project. This should be a clear synopsis of your project aimed at a your non-coder.

Utilizing extra data is permitted, but must be gathered externally, no internally created matrices/dataframes will be permitted.
